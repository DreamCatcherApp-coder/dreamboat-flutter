    "guideStage1Title": "1. MILD Technique (Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams)",
    "guideStage1Subtitle": "Planting the Seed of Awakening in Your Dreams",
    "guideStage1Content": "This is the starting point of the lucid dreaming journey. MILD, or \"Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams\", is a technique of planting a clear intention into the subconscious before falling asleep. This intention allows you to catch the awareness of \"I am dreaming\" during a dream. We will open the first door to conscious dreaming at this stage.",
    "guideStage1Importance": "MILD uses the mind's ability to recall and form intentions to prepare a mental ground for lucid dreaming. By activating the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, it increases the probability of being conscious in a dream.",
    "guideStage1Steps": "After waking from a dream at night, try to recall your last dream in detail.\nRepeat this sentence to yourself: \"In my next dream, I will realize that I am dreaming.\"\nVisualize this scene in your mind. Imagine yourself being aware in the dream.\nClose your eyes and go back to sleep with this intention.\nWrite in detail in your dream journal when you wake up in the morning.",
    "guideStage1Criteria": "If you realized you were dreaming at least once in a week, you can proceed to the next stage.",
    "guideStage1BrainNote": "This is a journey of awakening. In the first step, you start training your mind. Every repetition means conscious dreams are one step closer. Remember, patience and repetition are your greatest allies.",
    "guideStage2Title": "2. WBTB (Wake Back To Bed)",
    "guideStage2Subtitle": "Opening the Door to Conscious Dreaming",
    "guideStage2Content": "You have formed your mental intention. Now, we will learn to consciously re-enter the REM phase where dreams are most intense. The WBTB technique significantly increases lucid dream potential by allowing you to fall back asleep in a semi-awake state.",
    "guideStage2Importance": "With WBTB, your brain stays between wakefulness and sleep. This transition point provides the most suitable mental environment for lucid dreams.",
    "guideStage2Steps": "Set an alarm to wake up 4–6 hours after falling asleep.\nRead a book in low light, meditate, or repeat MILD for 15–30 minutes.\nAt the end of this time, lie down again and fall asleep with the MILD intention.",
    "guideStage2Criteria": "If you gained awareness of your surroundings in your dream at least 2 nights in a week, you can proceed to the next stage.",
    "guideStage2BrainNote": "You are opening your mind a little more. The veil between dream and reality is thinning. You are about to meet the dream with wakefulness.",
    "guideStage3Title": "3. WILD (Wake Initiated Lucid Dream)",
    "guideStage3Subtitle": "Direct Entry into Dream with Consciousness",
    "guideStage3Content": "One of the most impressive techniques of lucid dreaming, WILD takes you directly into the dream realm consciously. You allow your body to sleep while your mind stays awake before sleeping, and you transition into the dream without even blinking.",
    "guideStage3Importance": "WILD requires simultaneous execution of mental clarity and physical relaxation. This technique is different from others as you enter the dream directly and requires a high level of practice.",
    "guideStage3Steps": "Apply after WBTB.\nLie down, relax your entire body.\nFocus on your breath, keep your mind active.\nYou may see lights, patterns while your eyes are closed — watch calmly.\nTake control when you realize the dream has started.",
    "guideStage3Criteria": "If you have transitioned directly into a dream consciously at least once in 2 weeks, you are ready for stage 4.",
    "guideStage3BrainNote": "Now you are on the threshold of mastery. You are learning to close your eyes and open them in another world. Remember, this technique requires a lot of practice and patience is your greatest ally.",
    "guideStage4Title": "4. Time Awareness and Reality Checks",
    "guideStage4Subtitle": "Mastering Our Perception of Reality",
    "guideStage4Content": "Awareness of lucid dreams has started. Now it's time to deepen this awareness and use the concept of time-space in the dream. The goal at this stage: to remember concepts such as year, age, date while dreaming.",
    "guideStage4Importance": "Reality checks make it easier to realize you are dreaming. Time perception shows the depth of mental awareness.",
    "guideStage4Steps": "Ask \"Am I dreaming right now?\" at least 5–10 times a day.\nDo tests like counting fingers, re-reading text.\nBefore sleeping, repeat the intention: \"I will notice what year I am in in my dream.\"",
    "guideStage4Criteria": "If you experienced time-related awareness in your dream 3 nights in a week (e.g., year, birthday, calendar) → you can proceed to the next stage.",
    "guideStage4BrainNote": "You are aware not only that you are in a dream but also of the time in the dream. Your mind has started to move to a new dimension.",
    "guideStage5Title": "5. Sleep Routine Optimization",
    "guideStage5Subtitle": "Preparing the Ground for Lucid Dreaming",
    "guideStage5Content": "At this stage, we take a break from direct lucid dream attempts. It is time to build a regular sleep routine to support the brain's basic mechanism and deepen mental clarity.",
    "guideStage5Importance": "Regular sleep and an ideal environment directly affect lucid dreaming success. A regular rhythm is required for the healthy progression of REM duration.",
    "guideStage5Steps": "Create a sleep-wake schedule at the same time every day.\nDo a digital detox 1 hour before bed.\nTake care to sleep in a quiet, dark, cool room.\nCalm the mind with short meditations.",
    "guideStage5Criteria": "If you kept a dream journal for 7 nights over 10 days and experienced awareness signals in 3 of your dreams → you can proceed to the next stage.",
    "guideStage5BrainNote": "A building cannot exist without a foundation. This stage establishes a solid ground for your conscious dreams. Remember, a rested mind means a conscious mind.",
    "guideStage6Title": "6. Dopamine Balance",
    "guideStage6Subtitle": "Balancing Mind Chemistry",
    "guideStage6Content": "Your mind has now met lucid dreaming. At this stage, we take a step back from dream practice and prepare the environment that will increase the quality of lucid dreams by regulating your mental chemistry.",
    "guideStage6Importance": "Dopamine is the center of motivation, imagination, and the reward system. Excessive stimuli disrupt this balance and reduce dream clarity.",
    "guideStage6Steps": "Limit your social media time to 1 hour for 5 days.\nGet light exercise, walk, and sunlight.\nEat rich in Omega-3, stay away from sugar.\nDo focus exercises before sleep.",
    "guideStage6Criteria": "If you consciously managed the environment, light, or an object in 2 lucid dreams in a week, you can proceed to the final stage.",
    "guideStage6BrainNote": "You didn't just train your mind, you optimized its biological structure. Now conscious dreams are not just possible; they are becoming your nature.",
    "guideStage7Title": "7. Advanced Consciousness and Creative Manipulation",
    "guideStage7Subtitle": "Becoming the Master of the Dream",
    "guideStage7Content": "We have come to the end of the journey. At this point, you will not only be lucid but reach the level to consciously change the dream content. It is time to freely create your dream world.",
    "guideStage7Importance": "With this technique, you can access the subconscious, face fears, and test everything you imagine. This is a revolution both mentally and spiritually.",
    "guideStage7Steps": "Write down and imagine the scenario you want to do in the dream in detail.\nConsciously change the place, time, character, or outcome in the dream.\nAdd mindfulness meditations to your daily routine.",
    "guideStage7Criteria": "If you have performed active manipulation in at least 2 dreams in 2 weeks (flying, changing the environment, summoning something), you are a lucid dreaming master.",
    "guideStage7BrainNote": "At the end of this journey, not only conscious dreams but the limitless potential of your imagination awaits you. You are now creating life not only when awake but also when asleep.",

    "guideSlide1Title": "The Wisdom of Ancient Egypt",
    "guideSlide1Subtitle": "Gateway to the Soul's Journey",
    "guideSlide1Content1": "Traces of what we call lucid dreaming today could be seen in Ancient Egypt. The Egyptians interpreted dreaming as a conscious experience within the framework of the cultural and spiritual beliefs of the period.\n\nIndeed, symbolic narratives exist describing Pharaohs interacting with divine figures in the dream realm through priests.",
    "guideSlide1Content2": "In modern medicine, sleep research in the field of somnology has observed that the frontal cortex is active during REM sleep, meaning the areas of the brain associated with consciousness and awareness work similarly to when awake. These findings are interpreted as bearing some conceptual similarities to the conscious experience narratives attributed to dreaming in Ancient Egypt.",
    
    "guideSlide2Title": "Meditations of Tibetan Monks",
    "guideSlide2Subtitle": "Transcending the Limits of the Mind",
    "guideSlide2Content1": "Tibetan monks, through deep meditation practices lasting a lifetime, treated lucid dreaming as an inner experience aimed at increasing mental awareness.\n\nHigh in the Himalayas, monks exploring the layers of the mind supported conscious dream experiences with mental discipline and traditional practices.",
    "guideSlide2Content2": "In recent neurological studies, the relationship between meditation practices and sleep awareness has been examined.\n\nIn light of these ancient traditions, this special guide we prepared aims to awaken this potential in the depths of your mind and carry your awareness to the dream realm. You can start the journey of becoming the conscious architect of your own inner world, leaving behind being just a spectator in your dreams.",
    
    "guideSlide3Title": "The Secret of Dreamcatchers",
    "guideSlide3Subtitle": "Guardian of Conscious Dreams",
    "guideSlide3Content1": "In Native American cultures, the dreamcatcher was seen as a symbolic object associated with lucid dreams.\n\nThis practice, passed down through generations, was interpreted as a cultural symbol representing dream experiences. Under the guidance of shamans, the dreamcatcher was valued as a symbol associated with conscious awareness and symbolizing spiritual connections.",
    "guideSlide3Content2": "In the modern information age, lucid dreaming is treated not only as a mystical experience of ancient cultures but also as a consciousness experience studied in modern scientific research.\n\nIn this lucid dreaming guide, created by compiling the most current research and teachings passed down from generation to generation, it is possible for you to discover different experiences by deepening your mental awareness.",
